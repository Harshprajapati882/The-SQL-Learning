# SQL Notes

## What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and creating and modifying database structures.

## History of SQL
- **1970**: Edgar F. Codd introduces the relational model for databases.
- **1974**: The first version of SQL is developed by IBM.
- **1986**: SQL is standardized by ANSI (American National Standards Institute).
- **1992**: SQL-92 is released, enhancing the language with new features.
- **1999**: SQL:1999 introduces object-oriented features.
- **2003**: SQL:2003 adds XML-related features.
- **2011**: SQL:2011 introduces temporal data support.

## ANSI
ANSI SQL is the standard version of SQL defined by the American National Standards Institute. It serves as a guideline for SQL implementations across different database systems.

## ACID
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure reliable processing of database transactions:
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
- **Consistency**: Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are executed independently of one another.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

## CRUD
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations for managing data in a database:
- **Create**: Add new records.
- **Read**: Retrieve existing records.
- **Update**: Modify existing records.
- **Delete**: Remove records.

## Why SQL?
SQL is widely used due to its powerful capabilities for data manipulation, ease of use, and the ability to handle large volumes of data efficiently. It is also supported by many database systems.

## How SQL Works
SQL works by sending queries to a database management system (DBMS), which processes the queries and returns the results. The DBMS interprets SQL commands and interacts with the database to perform the requested operations.

## SQL Architecture
SQL architecture typically consists of three layers:
1. **User Interface**: Where users interact with the database.
2. **SQL Engine**: Processes SQL commands and manages data.
3. **Database Storage**: Where data is physically stored.

## Flow Chart
A flow chart can illustrate the process of a SQL query from user input to data retrieval.

## RDBMS vs DBMS
- **DBMS (Database Management System)**: A software system that enables the creation and management of databases. It provides a way to store, retrieve, and manage data.
- **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**: A type of DBMS that is based on the relational model. It organizes data into tables and allows for relationships between them.
